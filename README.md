# SWIGGY ANALYTICS CHALLENGE (GEEKS FOR GEEKS) 2022
This project is done as a part of Swiggy data analytics challenge conducted through Geeks for Geeks .

The project has been coded in python data science concepts and also added to that the file will be in a jupyter notebook extension ".ipynb". You can search online
on how to open .ipynb files.

The dataset is availabe on Kaggle along with the notebook with necessary questions asked on the challenge. For solutions you can refer to this notebook .

Also I have used many querying concepts like sqldf modules to query directly on dataframes.

Have a nice day :)
